After joining AnyPay Inc., my colleagues and I had been working on a new application called 'paymo' to make it an internal project. I experienced work flow with more than 8 people, coding highly maintainable tests, and refactoring from architecture. I was involved in crypto space since fall in 2017, technically, I use React Native and Ethereum. In that project, as the backend consists of micro services, I code Go, node.js, or Ruby when backend task is stuck.",
