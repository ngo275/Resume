  "career-description": "I entered the university of Tokyo in April of 2012, and spent most of my university days on lacrosse. My major was engineering, and I got interested in programming then. Though I proceeded to graduate school in March of 2016, I dropped out in one year, because I was strongly into startup. After dropout I entered AnyPay inc that runs some payment services, as a software engineer. Since fall of 2017 I have been involved in blockchain, or crypto, projects.",
