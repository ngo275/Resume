  "career-description": "I entered the University of Tokyo in April of 2012, where I had been dedicated myself to lacrosse for whole 4 years. I majored in software engineering, and got interested in programming then. Though I proceeded to a graduate school in April of 2016, I decided to leave it in one year since I was into start-up. \n\nAfter leaving the graduate school, I entered AnyPay as a software engineer, which was providing payment services. Since fall of 2017 I had been involved in blockchain, or crypto projects for over one year.\n\nIn November of 2018, since I started to feel like exposing myself to a global environment, I left AnyPay and joined Pand.ai, a Singaporean start-up company providing a chatbot for big financial institutes. At Pand.ai I worked on frontend stuff.\n\nIn May of 2019, I decided to join Credify as a co-founder to create a new way to represent a credibility. Credify has members in Japan, the UK, and Vietnam, so I will be in one of those cities.",

  "work-description": "As an internship I had been involved in media(web, iOS) applications for young women, where I developed not only iOS but its backend on AWS.\n\nAfter joining AnyPay, I had been working on a new application called 'paymo'. I was a very first full-time iOS engineer so I designed its architecture with a lead Android engineer. I experienced a development in a team of over 10 people, coding highly maintainable tests, and refactoring from an architecture level. I got involved in a crypto project since fall in 2017. I used React Native and Ethereum. In that project, since its backend consisted of micro services, I coded Go, Node.js, and Ruby as well as React Native. \n\nIn December of 2018, I started building a web frontend using React.js & Redux at Pand.ai. I almost rewrote that project from scratch.",
